# Search Query Contributor [](id=search-query-contributor)

## What does this sample do when it's deployed? [](id=what-does-this-sample-do-when-its-deployed)

This sample allows searching for blog entries based on the caption value of the blog image.

Steps to test this feature:
- Add the "Search Bar" and "Search Results" portlets to a web page;
- Add a blog entry filling the field caption located below the blog's image and above the blog's title.
- Try to search by the entry on the search bar portlet using caption value. No result must be displayed on search results portlet.
- Deploy the module.
- Try to search by the entry on the search bar portlet using caption value. The matching blog entry must be displayed on search results portlet.

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight? [](id=what-apis-and-or-code-components-does-this-sample-highlight)

This sample leverages the [KeywordQueryContributor](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/portal-search/portal-search-spi/src/main/java/com/liferay/portal/search/spi/model/query/contributor/KeywordQueryContributor.java) API.

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component? [](id=how-does-this-sample-leverage-the-apis-and-or-code-component)

This sample conveys the recommended approach to adding a field, which may contribute to the relevance of the search, in keyword queries.

To achieve this goal, you need to create a component that implements the `com.liferay.portal.search.spi.model.query.contributor.KeywordQueryContributor`.

Specifically, you must implement the `contribute` method, which is invoked when a user enters something in the search bars:

```.java
@Override
public void contribute(
    String keywords, BooleanQuery booleanQuery,
    KeywordQueryContributorHelper keywordQueryContributorHelper) {

    SearchContext searchContext =
        keywordQueryContributorHelper.getSearchContext();

    queryHelper.addSearchLocalizedTerm(
        booleanQuery, searchContext, Field.CAPTION, true);
}
```

This method uses Declarative Services to get a reference for the `QueryHelper` to invoke the `addSearchLocalizedTerm` method.

Also, it is important to highlight the `@Component` annotation that register a new service to the OSGI:

```.java
@Component(
	immediate = true,
	property = "indexer.class.name=com.liferay.calendar.model.Calendar",
	service = KeywordQueryContributor.class
)
```

To chose between implementing a `KeywordQueryContributor` or a `ModelPreFilterContributor`
consider these below items:
- Filters are cached and don't influence the score, therefore faster than queries.
- Query is usually something that the users type and pretty much unpredictable, while filters help users narrowing down the search results , for example using facets.
