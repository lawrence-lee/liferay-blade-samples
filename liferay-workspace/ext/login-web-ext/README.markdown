# Login Web Ext [](id=login-web-ext)

## What does this sample do when it's deployed? [](id=what-does-this-sample-do-when-its-deployed)

The Login Ext Module sample lets you customize the original Liferay module almost source code.
This example replaces the default login.jsp file in the com.liferay.login.web bundle
by adding the addtional text `"Hello from com.liferay.login.web.ext module"` to the Sign In form
and replaces the `ForgotPasswordMVCRenderCommand` class to print the text `"In ForgotPasswordMVCRenderCommand render"` to the console.

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight? [](id=what-apis-and-or-code-components-does-this-sample-highlight)

This sample demonstrates how to create a ext module and configure it to replace an original module bundle.

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component? [](id=how-does-this-sample-leverage-the-apis-and-or-code-component)

You can create your own ext module project by

- Declaring the original module name and version.
- Providing the source code that will replace the original one's.

To properly declare the original module in the `build.gradle` file (only support Gradle now), you must specify the
original module's Bundle Symbolic Name and the original module's exact version. In this example, this is configured like this:

    originalModule group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.login.web", version: "2.0.4"

You should put your ext module project in `LiferayWorkspaceDir./ext` by default, or you can specify it in `gradle.properties` by adding:

    liferay.workspace.ext.dir=ext

Then you need provide your own code intended to replace the original one. **Be sure
to mimic the original module's folder structure when overriding its JAR.**

If you are developing ext module project in standealone mode(not associating with Liferay workspace),
you also need to declare the ext gradle plugin in your `build.gradle`.

    apply plugin: 'com.liferay.osgi.ext.plugin'

## What Is the Ext module difference with OSGGI Fragment module? [](id=what-is-the-difference)

After you deployed your ext project in portal, you will see the original module will be stopped
(`com.liferay.login.web_2.0.4`), and then you bundle `com.liferay.login.web_2.0.4.ext` will be started,
 which is different from the fragment that still running the host bundle.

## What kind of type's file could be overlay? [](id=what-kind-of-type)
`Java, Css, Javascript, Language.properties, Scss, Soy` etc

It depends on the [Ext Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/sdk/gradle-plugins/src/main/java/com/liferay/gradle/plugins/LiferayOSGiExtPlugin.java),
 who can help you compile the code into the jar. Such as `.scss`, they'll be compiled into .css files for you which will be included in your module's .jar file artifact. This is done by the buildCSS task.

## Where Is This Sample? [](id=where-is-this-sample)

There are two different versions of this sample, each built with a different
build tool:

- [Gradle](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/master/gradle/ext/login-web-ext)
- [Liferay Workspace](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/master/liferay-workspace/ext/login-web-ext)
